- ✅ Added `aria-hidden` to mobile menu overlay based on open/closed state

#### Profile.jsx

- ✅ Added `aria-label="Profile"` to section

## 9.2 Keyboard Navigation Support ✅

### Changes Made:

#### Navigation.jsx

- ✅ Added focus indicators to logo button: `focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-cyan-400 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-slate-900 rounded px-2 py-1`
- ✅ Added focus indicators to all desktop navigation buttons
- ✅ Enhanced hamburger button focus indicator with ring offset
- ✅ Added focus indicators to all mobile menu buttons

#### Contact.jsx

- ✅ Added focus indicators to email link
- ✅ Added focus indicators to LinkedIn link

### Focus Indicator Style:

All interactive elements now have consistent, visible focus indicators using Tailwind's focus utilities:

- `focus:outline-none` - Removes default browser outline
- `focus:ring-2` - Adds 2px ring
- `focus:ring-cyan-400` - Uses cyan color matching the theme
- `focus:ring-offset-2` - Adds spacing between element and ring
- `focus:ring-offset-slate-900` - Matches dark background color
- `rounded` - Ensures ring follows rounded corners
- `px-2 py-1` or `px-4 py-2` - Adds padding for better click/focus targets

## 9.3 Color Contrast Verification ✅

### Verification Results:

All color combinations meet **WCAG 2.1 Level AAA** standards (7:1 for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text).

#### Contrast Ratios:
